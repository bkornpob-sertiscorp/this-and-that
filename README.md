# this-and-that
this-and-that has stuff worth sharing.
  1-basic-use-xgboost gives a quick introduction on how to use xgboost with CPU or GPU. It uses the diamond dataset in seaborn. It is assumed that you have your environment setup for the XGBoost. I suggest checking these sites for the setup: [the official XGBoost website](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), [this article](https://medium.com/rapids-ai/rapids-23-10-release-075aa5a50570#0ebc). Especially, the latter one I followed for the GPU setup.
